# üåç Global Health Insights Analysis: Causes of Death

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a thorough analysis of global health data, focusing on the leading causes of death worldwide. By leveraging Excel, we sought to uncover trends, correlations, and insights that could inform public health initiatives. The creation of an interactive dashboard in Excel allowed us to explore the dataset from multiple angles.

## Data Overview
The dataset titled `cause_of_deaths.csv` includes vital information regarding global mortality rates:
- **Year**: The year the data point represents.
- **Country/Territory**: The geographical area the data pertains to.
- **Causes of Death**: Various causes of death, such as Cardiovascular Diseases, HIV/AIDS, Diabetes Mellitus, and others.

## Objectives
- Identify the top causes of death globally and regionally.
- Perform data cleaning and preparation using Excel Pivot tables.
- Analyze key aspects of the dataset with visual charts (e.g., pie charts, bar charts).
- Utilize advanced Excel features for deeper analysis, including macros and custom formulas.
- Create an interactive dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of the data.

## Dataset
The dataset `cause_of_deaths.csv` provides a comprehensive view of mortality causes, allowing for in-depth exploration and analysis. It contains data across multiple countries and years, ensuring a rich context for our analysis.

## Process Details
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: The initial step involved loading the dataset into Excel. We cleaned the data to remove inconsistencies and handle missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - In Excel, we utilized **Pivot Tables** to summarize the data effectively.
3. **Data Transformation**: Data was transformed for deeper insights, such as grouping by year and country to assess trends.
4. **Visualization Creation**: 
   - In Excel, we created visualizations using Pivot Tables, including:
     - **Pie Charts** for proportional representation of causes of death.
     - **Bar Charts** to display trends over time.
     - **Line Charts**: Employed to visualize trends, such as the trend of cardiovascular diseases over time, allowing for clear comparison of changes across years.
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: 
   - An interactive dashboard was developed in Excel, integrating various visualizations to allow users to filter data dynamically by year and country. This dashboard includes the following plots:
     - **Total Deaths by Country and Year**: This plot displays the overall mortality rate across different countries for each year, helping to identify regions with the highest death tolls.
     - **Sum of Deaths Over Countries**: This summary shows the total number of deaths aggregated across all countries, offering a global perspective on mortality.
     - **Top Countries in Cardiovascular Diseases**: This plot highlights the countries with the highest rates of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, emphasizing regions that may need targeted health interventions.
     - **Trend of Cardiovascular Diseases Over Time**: This visualization illustrates how the mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases have changed over the years, providing insights into public health trends.
     - **Comparison of Two Diseases by Country Over Time**: This plot allows users to compare the trends of two different causes of death within specific countries, facilitating a deeper understanding of health challenges.

## Analysis
- **Top Causes of Death**: Analysis revealed the most common causes of death globally, with a specific focus on how these causes vary by region and year.
- **Trend Analysis**: Through Excel, we examined how certain diseases, especially Cardiovascular Diseases, have increased over time.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Excel‚Äôs data visualization tools helped in identifying relationships between different causes of death.

## Key Insights üåü
- Cardiovascular Diseases are consistently the leading cause of death across many countries, with a notable increase over the years.
- Strong correlations were observed between certain causes of death, indicating potential areas for public health intervention.
- Regional differences in mortality causes highlight the need for tailored health strategies based on local conditions.

## Data Source
The dataset for this analysis is sourced from a global health repository, ensuring accuracy and comprehensiveness regarding various causes of death across different countries and years.
- File Name: cause_of_deaths_FINAL (Recovered).xlsm

## Tools & Techniques Used
- **Software**: Microsoft Excel
- **Features**: 
  - Data Manipulation: Excel Pivot Tables
  - Visualization: 
    - **Pie Charts**: Used for showing the proportion of each cause of death.
    - **Bar Charts**: Displayed trends over time for different causes of death.
    - **Line Charts**: Employed to visualize trends, such as the trend of cardiovascular diseases over time, allowing for clear comparison of changes across years.
  - Advanced Excel Features: Macros and custom formulas for enhanced analysis
  - Interactive Dashboard: Combined visual elements to allow dynamic data exploration

## Results of Data Analysis Process
### Descriptive Statistics
- We generated summary statistics that revealed the distribution of deaths for each cause.
- Identified and handled outliers and missing data.

### Trends Over Time
- The analysis indicated that Cardiovascular Diseases have shown a consistent upward trend globally.
- Other diseases like HIV/AIDS displayed varied trends depending on the region and year.

### Visualizations
- Multiple interactive visualizations were created in Excel to illustrate key insights, focusing on clarity and engagement.

## Reports:
Reports were created to effectively communicate the insights and finding from the data analysis.



## Conclusion
This project has provided significant insights into global health trends, particularly the rise of cardiovascular diseases. The integration of Excel as a data analysis tool has demonstrated the power of spreadsheets in deriving meaningful insights. The interactive dashboard enhances user experience and understanding of the data, making it a valuable resource for public health policy discussions.
